# ðŸ“¸ Photo Setup Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Add Your 3 Photos to Make It Personal!**

### **Required Photos:**

1. **`laughter.jpg`** - For Mission 1 (Weird Laughter)
   - A photo of Mummy Lubnah laughing or smiling
   - This will show when the laughter question appears

2. **`math.jpg`** - For Mission 2 (Math Homework Help)  
   - A photo related to studying, math, or Mummy Lubnah being smart
   - Could be her with books, at a desk, or any academic moment

3. **`pool.jpg`** - For Mission 3 (BSK Swimming Pool)
   - The actual photo from the BSK swimming pool adventure
   - Or any swimming/water-related photo of her

### **How to Add Photos:**

1. **Rename your photos** to exactly match these names:
   - `laughter.jpg`
   - `math.jpg` 
   - `pool.jpg`

2. **Copy them** into the same folder as your website files:
   ```
   C:\Users\Hi\CascadeProjects\mission-pikachu\
   ```

3. **Photo Requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, JPEG, PNG, or WEBP
   - Size: Any size (they'll auto-resize to fit)
   - Quality: Good enough to see her beautiful face! ðŸ˜Š

### **Alternative Names (if you prefer):**
You can also use these names and I'll update the code:
- `lubnah_laugh.jpg`
- `lubnah_study.jpg` 
- `lubnah_pool.jpg`

### **What Happens:**
- Each photo will appear with beautiful 3D tilt effects
- They'll zoom and show captions when hovered
- If a photo doesn't load, it falls back to a placeholder
- Photos are optimized for both desktop and mobile

### **ðŸŽ¨ Pro Tips:**
- **Portrait orientation** works best for mobile
- **Clear, well-lit photos** look amazing with the effects
- **Close-up shots** of her face work great for emotional impact

Once you add the photos, the quiz will become incredibly personal and touching! ðŸ’šâš¡âœ¨
